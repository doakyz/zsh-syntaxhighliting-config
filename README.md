# zsh-syntaxhighliting-config
A custom zshrc file with custom regex for syntax highlighting

This project is inspired by the [ChromaTerm](https://github.com/hSaria/ChromaTerm) project. Chromaterm can be used to highlight syntax based on regex

This the example taken from ChromaTerm repo:

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hSaria/ChromaTerm/main/.github/junos-show-interface.png)

The aim of this project is to recreate these results in a way that can be used with the zsh-syntax-hightlting plugin

As ChromaTerm is based on python, there will be some conversion required, but as both systems rely on regex there should be some amount of crossover
